The book consists of 41 pages and is divided into four chapters. The first chapter deals with the obstacles that may hinder the salik from attaining Allah's pleasure, such as ignorance, doubt, hypocrisy, arrogance, and heedlessness. The second chapter explains the levels of knowledge (ma'rifah) of Allah, from the lowest to the highest. The third chapter describes the states (ahwal) and stations (maqamat) of the salik along the path of suluk. The fourth chapter discusses the ultimate goal of suluk, which is annihilation in Allah (fana fillah) and subsistence by Allah (baqa billah).

Syekh Muhammad Nafis al-Banjari was born in Martapura, the capital of Banjar Sultanate, in 1735 (1148 H). He came from a noble family that traced its lineage to Sultan Suriansyah, the first Muslim ruler of Banjar who converted from Hinduism. He showed a great talent and intelligence since his childhood, which attracted the attention of the Sultan of Banjar. He was sent to Mecca to study and deepen his religious knowledge under various famous scholars, especially in the fields of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and tasawuf (Sufism).
 
He spent about 40 years in Mecca, where he also wrote his masterpiece, Ad-Durrun Nafis. He also received ijazah (authorization) from several Sufi orders, such as Shadhiliyyah, Qadiriyyah, Naqshbandiyyah, and Kubrawiyyah. He became one of the most respected and influential Sufi teachers in Mecca, attracting many students from different regions and backgrounds. He also maintained a close relationship with his homeland, sending letters and books to his relatives and followers in Banjar.
 
He returned to Banjar around 1775 (1189 H), where he continued his teaching and preaching activities. He also participated in the resistance movement against the Dutch colonialism, which had invaded and occupied Banjar since 1787 (1201 H). He was known as a staunch defender of Islam and the rights of the people. He died in Kelua, Tabalong district, in 1812 (1227 H), leaving behind a legacy of knowledge and piety that inspired many generations of Muslims in Southeast Asia.
