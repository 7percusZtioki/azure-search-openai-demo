Mstatc is a statistical software package that was developed by the Department of Crop and Soil Sciences at Michigan State University. It is designed to help students and researchers analyze their data using nonparametric methods, especially for applications in genetics and molecular biology. Mstatc can run on Windows 7 and other operating systems with the help of DOSBox, a free emulator that allows DOS programs to run on modern computers.
 
In this article, we will introduce some key features of Mstatc software and show how it can be used to perform various types of data analysis for agricultural research. We will also provide links to download Mstatc and DOSBox, as well as some helpful resources for learning how to use them.

## Key Features of Mstatc Software
 
Mstatc software has many features that make it suitable for analyzing agricultural data, such as:
 
- It can handle large data sets with up to 10,000 observations and 100 variables.
- It can perform descriptive statistics, frequency distributions, correlation analysis, regression analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), multivariate analysis, cluster analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), discriminant analysis, canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and more.
- It can perform nonparametric tests, such as Wilcoxon rank sum test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Friedman test, Cochran's Q test, Spearman rank correlation coefficient, Kendall's tau coefficient, Mann-Whitney U test, and more.
- It can perform bootstrap resampling and jackknife resampling to estimate standard errors and confidence intervals for various statistics.
- It can perform permutation tests to compare means, medians, variances, correlations, and other parameters between groups or treatments.
- It can perform power analysis and sample size calculation for various experimental designs and statistical tests.
- It can perform randomization tests to test the validity of randomization procedures and the assumptions of ANOVA.
- It can perform design of experiments (DOE) and generate optimal or near-optimal designs for various types of experiments.
- It can perform Bayesian analysis and compute posterior probabilities and predictive values for various hypotheses and parameters.
- It can generate graphs and charts to visualize the data and the results of the analysis.
- It can export the data and the results to text files or Excel files for further processing or presentation.
- It can load plug-ins that extend its functionality or add new features.

## How to Download and Install Mstatc Software
 
To use Mstatc software on Windows 7, you need to download two programs: Mstatc itself and DOSBox. Here are the steps to download and install them:

1. Go to [https://oncology.wisc.edu/mstat/](https://oncology.wisc.edu/mstat/) [^1^] and click on the Download tab. Choose the version of Mstatc that matches your operating system (Windows 32-bit or 64-bit) and download the zip file. Extract the zip file to a folder on your computer (for example, C:\Mstat).
2. Go to [http://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1](http://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1) [^2^] and download the installer for DOSBox. Run the installer and follow the instructions to install DOSBox on your computer.
3. Open DOSBox and type the following commands to mount the folder where you extracted Mstatc as drive D: (you can change D: to any other letter if you want):
`MOUNT D C:\MSTAT
D:`
4. Type `MSTAT` to run Mstatc software. You should see a welcome screen like this:
