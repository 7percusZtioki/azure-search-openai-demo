## What is Megaman X Corrupted?
  
Megaman X Corrupted is a fan-made game that is based on the framework of the SNES Megaman X series games. It features two playable characters, X and Zero, who have different abilities and playstyles. X can use his X-Buster and various upgrades that he can get from defeated enemies, while Zero can use his Z-Saber and a combo system that allows him to unleash powerful close-range attacks. The game also introduces a new skill and upgrade system that lets you customize your characters with different abilities and boosts.
  
The game diverges from the typical stage-based design of the original series and adopts a Metroidvania-style approach. The game has a single map with multiple fast-travel points where you can explore and progress by acquiring new abilities that are required to access certain areas. The game also has 12 different endings depending on your choices and actions throughout the game.
