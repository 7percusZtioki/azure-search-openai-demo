# How to Use NetSupport School 12 Keygen Software to Manage Your Classroom
  
NetSupport School 12 is a powerful classroom management software that allows teachers to monitor, control, and collaborate with their students. It offers a range of features such as screen monitoring, application and internet restriction, lesson objectives, student assessment, file transfer, and more. But how can you get this software for free? The answer is by using a keygen software.
  
A keygen software is a program that generates valid serial numbers or activation codes for a specific software. By using a keygen software, you can bypass the registration process and use the full version of NetSupport School 12 without paying anything. However, using a keygen software is illegal and risky, as it may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer or compromise your data. Therefore, we do not recommend using a keygen software for NetSupport School 12 or any other software.
