## Creating a Sound from Scratch
 
One of the main features of Applied Acoustics Chromaphone v1.0.6 WIN.OSX Incl. Keygen AiR - crack is that it allows you to create sounds from scratch using physical modeling synthesis. This means that you can simulate the behavior of real acoustic instruments or objects by adjusting their physical properties, such as material, shape, size, tension, damping, etc. You can also combine two different resonators to create complex and rich sounds.
 
To create a sound from scratch, follow these steps:

1. Open the software and click on the "New" button on the top left corner of the interface. This will open a blank preset with two resonators (A and B) and a mixer.
2. Select one of the resonators (A or B) by clicking on its name. You will see a panel with various parameters that you can adjust to change the sound of the resonator. For example, you can change the type of resonator (plate, string, membrane, etc.), the material (wood, metal, glass, etc.), the geometry (length, width, thickness, etc.), the coupling (how the resonator interacts with other resonators or objects), and the excitation (how the resonator is played or struck).
3. Experiment with different settings until you find a sound that you like. You can preview the sound by clicking on the keyboard at the bottom of the interface or by using your MIDI controller.
4. Repeat the same process for the other resonator (B) if you want to create a more complex sound. You can also adjust the volume and panning of each resonator in the mixer section.
5. Save your sound by clicking on the "Save" button on the top left corner of the interface. You can name your sound and choose a category for it.

## Editing an Existing Sound
 
If you want to edit an existing sound instead of creating one from scratch, you can use one of the presets that come with Applied Acoustics Chromaphone v1.0.6 WIN.OSX Incl. Keygen AiR - crack or load your own sound file. You can then modify the sound using the same parameters as before or use some additional features, such as effects, envelopes, LFOs, and modulation.
 
To edit an existing sound, follow these steps:

1. Open the software and click on the "Load" button on the top left corner of the interface. This will open a browser where you can choose a preset or a sound file from your computer.
2. Select a preset or a sound file that you want to edit and click on "Open". The software will load the sound and display its parameters in the interface.
3. Edit the sound as you wish using the same methods as before. You can also use some additional features to enhance your sound, such as:
    - Effects: You can add up to four effects to your sound, such as reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, etc. You can adjust the parameters of each effect in their respective panels.
    - Envelopes: You can control how your sound changes over time by adjusting its amplitude envelope (volume), filter envelope (brightness), and noise envelope (noise level). You can change the shape and duration of each envelope segment by dragging its handles.
    - LFOs: You can add some movement and variation to your sound by applying low-frequency oscillators (LFOs) to different parameters. You can choose from different waveforms (sine, triangle, square, etc.) and adjust their frequency and depth.
    - Modulation: You can modulate any parameter of your sound by using another parameter as a source. For example, you can modulate the pitch of your sound by using an LFO or an envelope as a source. You can adjust the amount and polarity of modulation in each parameter's panel.
4. Save your edited sound by clicking on the "Save" button on the top left corner of the interface. You can name your sound 8cf37b1e13
